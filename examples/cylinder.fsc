# Program to calculate the volume and surface area of a cylinder

info "This program calculates the volume and surface area of a cylinder.";

get "Height of the cylinder" h;
get "Radius of base" r;

curved_surface = 2 * PI * r * h;
base_surface   = 2 * (PI * r^2);

put "Volume of the cylinder"		   h * PI * r^2;
put "Surface area of the cylinder" curved_surface + base_surface;
